# Defender quarantine test files

`Quarantine/`: a Microsoft Defender quarantine folder written as Defender writes them, by
[ys-defender-history-parser](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/ys-defender-history-parser)'s
`tests/oracle/gen_quarantine.py` (MIT OR Apache-2.0; `tests/fixtures/written/Quarantine/` there).
Each part is RC4-encrypted with Defender's key, with the headers' sizes and CRCs and the contents'
SHA-1 names as Defender writes them; dissect.target's quarantine reader reads the same values from
it. The threat names, paths and identifiers are made up, and the quarantined "file" is a line of
text: nothing here is malware.
